![Alt text](https://images4.alphacoders.com/689/thumb-1920-689044.jpg)


## Overview
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of 53,940 rows and 10 variables, which provide insights into the characteristics influencing diamond prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **Color**: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best).
- **Clarity**: A measurement of how clear the diamond is, ranging from I1 (worst) to IF (best).
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage, calculated as \( \text{(2 * Z) / (X + Y)} \).
- **Table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point.
- **Price**: Price of the diamond in US dollars (target variable).
- **X**: Length of the diamond in mm.
- **Y**: Width of the diamond in mm.
- **Z**: Depth of the diamond in mm.
